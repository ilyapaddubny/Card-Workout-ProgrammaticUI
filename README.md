# Card Exercise App

This app is a simple exercise app that uses a UIImageView to display a card and a few buttons to control the card's rotation. The app also includes a rules button that displays a popup with the rules of the exercise.

This app was created to get a better understanding of the main principles of UIKit and ProgrammaticUI and inspired by the video [Swift Programming Tutorial | FULL COURSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwA1VWP0Ldw) by [Sean Allen](https://www.youtube.com/@seanallen).
